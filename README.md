# Cool CSS things

This repo is used to store cool learnings about CSS in order to re-use it when needed.

## Multiple hover effect

Multiple hover effect is a page that contains 8 images that are modified with a hover effect, changing not only the single image but also the adjacent ones. The basic code does not use JavaScript files, but some browsers do not support 'has()' in CSS, so it is necessary to use different scripts.

## Others

- The images are generated by: https://picsum.photos/
